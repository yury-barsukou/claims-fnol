  title: Claims and Content Submission API
  description: |
    Integration with this API empowers you to tailor to your users' experience within your system. When entering claims from your system
    of choice, you can control what is entered and have a record of what was provided at First Notice of Loss (FNOL) and First
    Report of Injury (FROI).  Upon successful submission the API will respond with an all numeric claim number for your 
    records. This number can be used to submit content and post FNOL messages for up to 18 months 
    post FNOL submission. In this document you will find the technical specifications (requirements) for claim 
    submission, content submission and post FNOL messaging.

        Content submission endpoint that supports sending up to _100_ _MB_ for WC and _300_ _MB_ per file for AUTOB, CGL and PROPC in two steps.

        **Step 1)** Send us an array of content metadata objects containing details like the name, type, and 
        extension. We save that for later, and return a presigned-URL for each metadata object you sent us. 
        The details for the request is in the "createDocs" operation below. 

        **Step 2)** You "PUT" the content to the presigned-URL. We'll pick it up and process it as soon as we see it.

        **Here's a CURL example for the PUT (step 2)**
        curl -X PUT -T path/to/file "the presigned URL we returned to you for the object"

        PUTs like the example above can be done with many popular languages, from a server or a browser; use
        the approach that best suits yours.

          description: 'Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes are four-digit numbers assigned by the U.S. government that categorize the industries to which companies belong, while also organizing industries by their business activities. These four-digit  SIC codes were created by the U.S. government in 1937 to classify and analyze economic activity across various industries and government agencies, and to promote uniformity in the presentation of data collected by various government agencies. The value entered for this field should represent the injured worker''s employer at the time of the injury or occupational illness.'
